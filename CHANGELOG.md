- Match all of the details from [passivbot](https://github.com/enarjord/passivbot)s telegram commands `/position` and `/open_orders` commands
- Store and display historical unrealized PnL
- Tidy up repeated code into functions

## 2022-01-03
### Changed
- Added a composite key to the income table in the database that makes the tradeId and trade reason unique, stopping duplicates from being mistakenly entered into the table from the API. This change requires a fresh DB install currently.

## 2021-12-27
### Changed
- Fixed an issue on history page where dowload buttons would cause 500 error when pressed
